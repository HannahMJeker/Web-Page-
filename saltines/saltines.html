				<h1>SALTINES</h1>
				<p>-Saltines are my favorite breakfast, lunch, after school, and after dinner <b>snack</b>. They are truly incredible. I can not believe people do not like them.</p>
				<p>-It doesn't have to be the name brand saltines either, they can be off brand and they are <b>still <u>impeccable</u></b> I mean they are just so good.</p> 
				<p>-I have always liked saltines, I ate them when I was sick and I thought they were really good, but now I don't just eat them when I am sick. I eat them all time</p>

			<p>*Although they are good they are dry, I don't think they are that dry but hey we all have our own opinions.</p>
			<p>*This cracker originated in North America.</p>
