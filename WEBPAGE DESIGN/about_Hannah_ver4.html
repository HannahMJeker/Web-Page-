		<h1>Welcome to Hannah Jeker's web page!</h1><hr />
		
		<p>I was born in <b>April</b> and I am an <b>Aries.</b> I grew up in Wilmington Delaware. My favorite color is blue, and I love dogs. <b>I have one dog named Jingle, and two fish named Georgia, and Sasha.</p>
		<p>I have two siblings, a twin sister named Darragh, and an older sister named kelly, she is 20 years old. My family is a family of five.</b></p>
		<p>I am really interested in the arts, I like to draw, and take pictures. Photography is the career I want to pursue.</p>
		<p>Some of my hobbies are listening to music, sleeping, watching Netflix, and swimming. I have been swimming since I was 3 years old. I used to run but now I hate running a lot.</p>
		<p>My favorite quote is<blockquote>You only get one spark of madness you mustn't lose it.</blockquote>My favorite movie is <i>The Wizard Of Oz</i></p>
